# Amit Kumar  
**Business Intelligence & Analytics | Data Analyst**

I design analytics and automation solutions that transform fragmented, manual reporting into decision-ready insights. My experience spans financial markets, operational analytics, and BI automation — with a focus on dashboards and pipelines stakeholders actually use.

**Featured:** production-grade automation for compliance documents, real-time trading dashboards, and reconciliation systems.
